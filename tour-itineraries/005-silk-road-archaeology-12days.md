## THE ARCHAEOLOGIST'S UZBEKISTAN

### Uncover Layers of History
This is **not a surface-level tour of monuments**. This is a deep archaeological expedition exploring:
- **Ancient Khorezm desert fortresses** (4th century BCE - 7th century CE)
- **Alexander the Great's campaigns** through Sogdiana
- **Buddhist stupas** and monasteries (pre-Islamic period)
- **Zoroastrian fire temples** (ruins in remote desert)
- **Islamic Golden Age** ruins and madrasahs
- **Timurid empire** archaeology
- **Soviet-era excavations** and discoveries
- **Active archaeological sites** (may see excavations in progress)

### What Makes This Different from Competitors

While other tours **drive past fortresses** for photo ops, we:
→ **Enter and explore** fortresses interiors (climb walls, enter rooms)
→ **Visit 15+ fortresses** (not just 2-3 popular ones)
→ **Hire archaeologist guides** (not standard tour guides reading facts)
→ **See current excavations** (when possible, meet archaeologists working)
→ **Access remote sites** (4x4 vehicles, camping gear for multi-day desert trips)
→ **Spend multiple days** in Kyzylkum Desert exploring fortress chains
→ **Interpret site layouts** (understand defensive architecture)
→ **Learn excavation techniques** (what to look for, how sites are dated)
