## THE MASTER CRAFTSMAN'S UZBEKISTAN

This is **not a tour where you watch demonstrations**. This is an immersive craft journey where you'll:
- **Weave your own silk scarf** on a traditional loom (take it home!)

- **Block-print fabrics** with natural dyes
- **Visit working silk factories** (not staged tourist shows)
- **Understand symbolism** in patterns, colors, and motifs

### What Makes This Different from Competitors

While other tours include **one 30-minute craft demonstration**, we include:
→ **8-10 hands-on workshops** (you create, not watch)
→ **Take home what you make** (silk scarf, ceramic bowl, embroidery, miniatures)
→ **Meet 3rd-4th generation masters** (working artisans, not performers)
→ **Workshop time: 2-4 hours each** (vs. competitors' 20-30 minutes)
→ **Behind-the-scenes access** (active production facilities, family workshops)
→ **Understand complete process** (from raw materials to finished art)
→ **Pattern and symbolism education** (what motifs mean culturally)
