   php artisan serve
   ```

   - URL: http://localhost:8000/admin
   - Login to Filament admin panel

3. Test the feature:
   - Navigate to Leads section
   - Click on any lead to edit
   - Look for the "Generate Email with AI" button in the header
   - Click it and fill in the modal:
     - Select tone (e.g., Professional)
     - Select email type (e.g., Initial Outreach)
     - Optionally add custom instructions

     - Email body is populated
     - AI metadata is saved
     - Strategy notes are added

4. Check the generated email:
   - Should reference company details (company name, country, etc.)

   - Should follow the selected tone
   - Should be 200-300 words

### Automated Testing (Optional)

## What the AI Does

The AI email generator:
1. **Analyzes lead data**: company name, website, country, tour types, certifications
2. **Considers context**: Does company already work with Uzbekistan?
3. **Personalizes email**: References specific company details
4. **Adapts tone**: Professional, friendly, persuasive, or consultative
5. **Generates**: Subject (50-70 chars) + Body (200-300 words)
6. **Logs conversation**: Stores in `lead_ai_conversations` table

## Example Use Cases

- Lead: Adventure Tours USA (no Uzbekistan partnership)

- Result: Introduction to Uzbekistan tourism opportunities

### Scenario 2: Follow-up with Canadian DMC

### Scenario 3: Re-engagement UK Agency
