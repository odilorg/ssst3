🎨 1. Color Palette Consistency

✅ Good alignment:

The form background (#FAFAFA–#FFF7F0 range) fits well with the Tour Details light-beige tone.

Blue “Submit Review” button matches the primary CTA color used in the tour detail “Book Now” button area.

⚠️ Minor mismatches:

The beige tone in the form section is slightly warmer/darker than the rest of the page background.
→ Fix: Use the same neutral background tone as the Tour Detail page (e.g., #FBFCFE or #F8FAFD) for full-page harmony.

The form border lines are very faint compared to the crisper card outlines on the tour page (like “What’s Included” cards).
→ Fix: Use the same border color token (around #E5E8F0) to maintain visual consistency.
🧩 2. Typography & Font Hierarchy

✅ Matches well:

Font style and size hierarchy (headings, body text) are similar to the tour detail layout.

Input placeholder typography matches the form style used in your Contact page—good brand consistency.

⚠️ Needs slight refinement:

“Write a Review” heading is smaller and tighter spaced than the Tour Detail’s section headers (e.g., “Highlights”, “Cancellation Policy”).
→ Fix: Increase font size to 28px semibold (H2 token) and add ~8px bottom margin.

Field labels (“Your Rating”, “Review Title”) use a lighter weight than Contact/Tour Detail forms.
→ Fix: Make labels medium weight (#4A5874) for visual clarity.

📐 3. Padding & Spacing

⚠️ Inconsistent vertical rhythm:

The space between form fields is tighter than the spacing used on the Tour Detail’s accordion or info blocks.
→ Fix: Increase vertical gap between input fields to 20–24px.

The entire form block could use more top padding (~48px) before the first field to visually separate it from the previous section (“Customer Reviews”).

✅ Good:

Consistent horizontal padding on input fields matches other components.
🧱 4. Component Structure & Borders

✅ Aligned:

Inputs, textareas, and the primary button follow the same rounded-rectangle style used elsewhere.

Button color and hover behavior appear identical to “Book Now” → strong consistency.

⚠️ Improve:

The form fields could benefit from a subtle card container (white surface, light shadow, 12px radius, same as “Included” sections).
→ This aligns it visually with the “cards inside sections” pattern of the Tour Detail page.

⭐ 5. Icons & Interactive Elements

✅ Star rating icons feel consistent with the theme — good yellow accent similar to orange badges elsewhere.

⚠️ But:

The yellow hue (#FFB400) is more saturated than the brand-accent orange (#FFA63D).
→ Fix: Use the same accent tone as other orange highlights on the site for brand unity.

🧭 6. Alignment & Layout

Inputs and labels are perfectly left-aligned—good structure.

The “Submit Review” button width should match the “Send Message” / “Book Now” button width (full-width desktop, 80% tablet).

♿ 7. Accessibility & UX

✅ Good focus visibility on inputs and button.
✅ Clear required fields marking (*).
⚠️ Slightly improve error/validation feedback color — make it use brand-primary red instead of browser default.
