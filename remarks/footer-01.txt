### ⚙️ Suggestions for Improvement

#### 🧭 1. Link Styling

* The blue color for links (email, phone) feels slightly too vibrant compared to the footer’s muted palette.
* ✅ **Suggestion:** Use a **softer blue** (`#7FB5E1`) or switch to **white text with underline on hover** to maintain a unified look.

#### 📏 2. Column Padding

* Add **10–15px more horizontal spacing** between “Quick Links” and “Destinations” columns for better separation on large screens.

#### 🟡 3. Button Corner & Hover

* Round the yellow button corners (4–6px) for a friendlier tone.
* Add hover feedback (slight darken or soft shadow) to improve interactivity.

#### 📱 4. Mobile Responsiveness

* Ensure the newsletter form remains readable on smaller screens.
* On mobile, stack the input above the button for better usability.

#### 🧾 5. Divider Line & Legal Area

* Lighten divider line opacity to around 0.2 for a more subtle, modern effect.
* Center-align the copyright and legal text horizontally.
* Slightly reduce font size to differentiate it from the main footer content.

### ✨ Optional Enhancements

* Add **TripAdvisor / Google Review badges** for social proof.
* Include **social media icons** (Instagram, Facebook, YouTube) for quick navigation.
* Add **micro-animations** for newsletter button hover or icon interactions.
* Consider a **soft gradient or subtle background texture** (Silk Road motif, map silhouette) for visual richness.
