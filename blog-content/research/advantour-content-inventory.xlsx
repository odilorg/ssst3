BLOG/NEWS POSTS (from news.htm - need to examine individually):
- Will list specific news articles found

PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS:
- Structure seems to be destination guides, not blog posts with dates
- News section appears to be actual blog-style updates
- Need to determine: Is this a "blog" or "guide library"?
- This affects our content strategy significantly


Note: Manual research in progress. Will update as I analyze each page.
