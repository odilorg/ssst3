### **Section 3: Archaeological Techniques - Reading the Sites (600 words)**

**H2:** How Archaeologists Interpret Khorezm Fortresses

**Educational section - appeal to archaeology enthusiasts**

**H3:** Dating Techniques
- Pottery typology (styles change over centuries)
- Coin analysis (dates minted)
- Carbon-14 (organic materials)
- Historical texts (no Khorezm written records survive - all external)
- Multiple lines of evidence = confidence

**H3:** Reading Stratigraphy (Layer Analysis)
- Different soil layers = different time periods
- Darker layers = occupation (ash, organic)
- Lighter layers = abandonment
- How to "read" excavation walls

**H3:** Fortress Architecture Analysis
- **Defensive features:** Wall thickness, height, bastions, parapets
- **Construction phases:** Different brick sizes, repair patterns
- **Functional areas:** Residential vs administrative vs religious
- **Engineering:** Drainage systems, water storage

**H3:** Artifact Analysis
- What's most common? (POTTERY!)
- What pottery tells us: dates, trade connections, daily life
- Metalwork (tools, weapons)
- Textile fragments (rare in desert)
- Coins (critical for dating)

**H3:** Why Adobe Construction?
- Local materials (mud, sand, straw)
- Good insulation (hot days, cold nights)
- But vulnerable to erosion (why preservation difficult)
- Desert climate helps (low rainfall = better preservation)

**H3:** Conservation Challenges Today
- Wind erosion (major factor)
- Tourist damage (walking on walls)
- Lack of funding for preservation
- Climate change (Aral Sea disaster affecting local climate)
- Debate: Restore vs preserve as-is?

**Target Keywords:**
- "Khorezm archaeology"
- "Uzbekistan archaeological sites"
- "desert fortress archaeology"

**Style:** Educational but accessible (not too academic)
- Explain concepts in lay terms
- Use analogies
- Include photos to illustrate
