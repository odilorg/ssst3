  * Less water = less temperature moderation
  * Hotter summers, colder winters locally
  * Dust storms carry salt/pesticides
  * Regional climate altered
- **Can It Be Saved?**
  * North Aral (Kazakhstan): Dam built, slight recovery
  * South Aral (Uzbekistan): Likely unsaveable

**H2:** Aral Sea Expedition FAQs

**Q1: Why would I visit an environmental disaster zone?**
A: It's one of the most powerful environmental education experiences possible. Seeing it creates deeper understanding of water management, climate change, and human impact than any documentary. Plus, you'll support the remaining communities through tourism.

**Q2: Is it safe to camp there?**
A: Yes, with experienced guides. We have satellite phone, multiple vehicles, first aid, and professional risk management. The area is remote but not dangerous (low crime, environmental risks managed).

**Q3: Will I get sick from the toxic dust?**
A: Unlikely on short visit. We avoid dust storms when possible. Bring bandana/scarf for dust. People with severe asthma should consult doctor. Minor throat irritation possible (bring cough drops).

**Q4: How depressing is it?**
A: It's sobering and thought-provoking, not "fun" in traditional sense. But it's also hauntingly beautiful. The landscape has strange, post-apocalyptic beauty. Communities show remarkable resilience. Most travelers find it meaningful, not depressing.

**Q5: Can I take photos everywhere?**
A: Almost everywhere, yes. Ships, seabed, landscapes—all excellent photography. Ask permission before photographing people. Museum may have restrictions (signs posted). Respect sacred sites (Sultan Uvays).

**Q6: What's the bathroom situation?**
A: Hotels have normal facilities. While camping, we provide portable toilet tent (privacy, sanitation). No showers while camping (bring wet wipes). It's rugged but manageable for 2 nights.

**Q7: Do I need special insurance?**
A: Yes. Standard travel insurance often excludes "expedition" activities. Get policy covering remote area evacuation. We recommend [specific provider TBD]. Always read policy details.

**Q8: What if I can't handle the heat?**
A: We travel primarily in spring/fall (ideal temperatures). Summer trips are more challenging. If you're heat-sensitive, choose April-May or September-October. Stay hydrated, take breaks, wear sun protection.

**Q9: Are there bugs or dangerous animals?**
A: Very few. Desert environment isn't hospitable. No dangerous large animals (some wild sheep, gazelles). Rare scorpion (shake out shoes in morning). Mosquitoes minimal. Spiders present but not dangerous.

**Q10: Can kids go on this expedition?**
A: Not recommended under 16 due to:
  * Long, boring drives for children
  * Emotional weight of environmental story
  * Basic camping (no amenities)
  * Heat/cold extremes
  * Remote location if medical issue

**Q11: How do I explain this trip to people who think it's morbid?**
A: Frame as environmental education, not disaster tourism. You're not exploiting tragedy—you're learning, supporting communities, and becoming advocate. "Visiting to understand and help" vs "gawking at tragedy."

**Q12: What's the single most impactful moment?**
A: Most travelers say: Standing at ship graveyard at sunrise. Scale of loss becomes visceral. Rusting ships in sand where water was 50 years ago. First moment you "get it." Very emotional for many.
