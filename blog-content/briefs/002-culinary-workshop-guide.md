**H3:** Step 1: Render the Fat (15 minutes)
- Heat kazan over fire/coals

**H3:** Step 3: Caramelize Onions (30-40 minutes) ⏰ MOST IMPORTANT
- Add sliced onions to fat/liquid
- Cook on medium-low heat
- Stir occasionally, be patient
- Go slow—this is where flavor develops
- Should be golden-brown, sweet, soft
- Chef's judgment: Smell it, taste it

**H3:** Step 4: Add Carrots (15 minutes)
- Add julienned carrots
- Stir frequently
- Carrots will soften, absorb flavors
- Should cook down significantly
- Entire mixture becomes cohesive base

**H3:** Step 5: Return Meat, Add Water (10 minutes)
- Return browned meat to pot
- Add water (hot water - not cold)
- Enough to cover ingredients by 1-2 inches
- Salt now (layer of seasoning)
- Bring to full boil

**H3:** Step 6: Add Rice in Even Layer - DON'T STIR! (Critical!)
- Drain soaked rice
- Distribute EVENLY over meat/veg mixture
- DO NOT STIR (ingredients on bottom steam rice)
- Add 2-3 whole garlic heads (nestled in rice)
- More hot water if needed to cover rice ½ inch above

**H3:** Step 7: First Steam Phase (15 minutes)
- Cover pot with tight lid
- Or: Cover with large plate, kitchen towel on top (seal in steam)
- High heat for 15 minutes (creates steam)
- Listen: Hear bubbling/moisture sound

**H3:** Step 8: Second Steam Phase (20-30 minutes) ⏰ TIMING CRITICAL
- Reduce heat to LOW
- Steam slowly
- DON'T LIFT LID (releases steam)
- Steam for 20-30 minutes until rice tender
- Check: Smell toasty, hear no more liquid bubbling

**H3:** Step 9: Create Air Holes (Vent Steam)

- Use wooden spoon handle
- Poke 5-6 holes through rice to bottom (vents steam)
- Allows steam to escape, prevents mushiness
- Critical traditional step

**H3:** Step 10: Final Steam (10 minutes)
- Keep lid on

- Rice absorbs all flavors

**H3:** Step 11: Rest (10 minutes off heat)
