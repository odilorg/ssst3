# COMPETITOR BLOG RESEARCH - MANUAL EXECUTION PLAN
## How to Research Competitor Blogs for Uzbekistan Content

---

## WHY MANUAL RESEARCH IS NEEDED

**WebSearch Limitations:**
- API rate limits prevent comprehensive automated scraping
- Search results show mixed content (not clean blog archives)
- Can't access detailed metrics (Ahrefs, SEMrush data behind paywall)

**Solution:** Manual research + use of free tools + strategic sampling

---

## MANUAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

### **Step 1: Identify All Competitor Blogs**

**Primary Competitors (Direct):**
1. **Advantour.com** - Market leader
2. **Kalpak Travel** - Premium competitor
3. **Orexca.com** - Historical focus
4. **Sogda Tour** - Budget option

**Secondary Competitors (Content Only):**
5. **The Culture Trip** - Media site
6. **Nomadic Matt** - Budget travel blogger
7. **Monday Bazaar Blog** - Independent traveler
8. **Journal of Nomads** - Travel blogger

**Tertiary Competitors (Indirect):**
9. **Lonely Planet Thorn Tree** - Forum (but user-generated content reveals questions people ask)
10. **TripAdvisor Uzbekistan Forum** - Same as above
11. **Reddit r/travel - Uzbekistan posts**

---

### **Step 2: Manually Extract Competitor Post Data**

**For Each Competitor Blog:**

**A. Find Their Blog Section:**
- Go to website
- Look for: "Blog", "Articles", "Travel Guide", "News"
- Document URL structure: advantour.com/news.htm, advantour.com/articles/, etc.

**B. Manually Review First 20-50 Posts:**
For each post, document:
- Post title
- URL
- Publish date
- Word count (estimate: use browser word counter or copy-paste)
- Main topic
- Keywords targeted (from title, headers, content)
- Images used (count, quality)
- Comments (yes/no, count if visible)
- Social shares (if visible)
- Internal links to tour pages

**C. Create Spreadsheet:**

| Competitor | Post Title | URL | Date | Word Count | Topic | Keywords | Images | Comments | Internal Links | Notes |
|------------|------------|-----|------|------------|-------|----------|--------|----------|----------------|-------|
| Advantour | Samarkand Travel Guide | ... | 2024 | 2,500 | Destination | Samarkand, Registan | 15 | 0 | Yes | Basic guide |
| Kalpak | Uzbekistan plov recipe | ... | 2023 | 1,200 | Food | plov, recipe | 8 | 3 | No | No video |

**D. Suggested Tools for Manual Research:**

**Free Tools:**
- **WordCounter.net**: Paste text to count words
- **Wildcard search**: site:advantour.com "Uzbekistan" filetype:html (in Google - limits results)
- **Google search operators**: "Uzbekistan" site:advantour.com - finds pages mentioning Uzbekistan
- **Wayback Machine**: See older versions of competitor sites
- **SEOquake extension**: Free Chrome/Firefox extension (shows basic SEO metrics)

**Freemium Tools:**
- **Ubersuggest**: 3 free searches/day - shows keyword ideas, content ideas
- **AnswerThePublic.com**: Free searches for question keywords
- **AlsoAsked.com**: Shows "People Also Ask" questions visually

**Paid Tools (Consider):**
- **Ahrefs 7-day trial** ($7) - Comprehensive competitor analysis
- **SEMrush 7-day trial** - Similar capabilities
- **One month** = deep research all competitors, then cancel

**E. Sample What to Research (Advantour Example):**

**Visit: https://www.advantour.com/uzbekistan/**

**Look for:**
- Link to "Travel Guide" or "Articles" or "Information"
- List of destination pages (Tashkent, Samarkand, Bukhara, Khiva)
- List of topic pages (Visa, Money, Food, Culture, History)
- Check if they have "news" or "blog" subdirectory

**Manually click through and document:**
- How many Uzbekistan-related pages total? (estimate)
- Do they have actual blog posts with dates? Or just static guides?
- What's the publish/update frequency?
- Average content length?
- Quality of information (depth, accuracy, detail)?
- Use of images/original photos?
- Internal linking strategy?
- Call to action placement?

---

### **Step 3: Use Free Tools to Estimate Performance**

**For Any Competitor Page (Free Methods):**

**A. Check if it Ranks (manual):**

For top keywords, Google:
- "Uzbekistan [topic]"
- "[City] travel guide"
- "[Food name] recipe Uzbekistan"

**See if competitor appears in:**
- Position 1-3 (page 1, top)
- Position 4-10 (page 1, lower)
- Position 11-20 (page 2)
- Not ranking (beyond page 2)

**B. Estimate Traffic (rough):**

Use Ubersuggest free searches:
- Enter competitor URL
- Shows estimated organic traffic (free 3 searches/day)
- Shows top pages by traffic
- Shows keywords they rank for

**C. Check Backlinks (limited):**

Use Ubersuggest:
- Shows some backlink data (not complete)
- Shows domain authority (free)

**D. Analyze Content Gaps:**

**Look for what they DON'T write about:**
- Photography tours? (probably not - no one offers)
- Culinary tours? (probably just food guides, not tour experiences)
- Textile workshops? (probably mention crafts but not hands-on)
- Archaeology expeditions? (probably mention fortresses but detailed tours?)
- Adventure/Aral Sea? (probably superficial coverage)
- Solo female travel specific? (probably general only)

**These gaps = OUR opportunities!**

---

### **Step 4: Research Keywords They Target**

**Method A: Read Their Content **
- Extract keywords from:
  * Page titles
  * H1, H2, H3 headers
  * First paragraph
  * Throughout content (what terms repeat?)
  * Image alt text (view page source)

** Method B: Use Google Search Console (if we had access) **
- Would show actual ranking keywords
- Not available for competitor research (privacy)

** Method C: Infer from URL Structure **
- advantour.com/uzbekistan/samarkand/ = keywords: Uzbekistan, Samarkand
- advantour.com/uzbekistan/food/plov.html = keywords: Uzbekistan, food, plov

** Document in spreadsheet: **
| Page URL | Inferred Keywords | Ranking Position (estimate) | Monthly Searches (if known) |

---

### ** Step 5: Create Competitor Content Database **

** For Each Competitor: **

** Create spreadsheet with tabs for: **
1. ** All Pages ** - Every page/post about Uzbekistan
2. ** Top Performing ** - What seems popular (based on comments, shares, recency, mentions)
3. ** Content Gaps ** - What they DON'T write about (our opportunities)
4. ** Keywords ** - Keywords they target
5. ** Tour Pages ** - How they promote tours in posts

** Example Database Structure: **

** Tab: Advantour - All Pages **
- Column A: Page URL
- Column B: Page Title
- Column C: Topic Category (Destination, Food, Culture, Practical, Tour)
- Column D: Word Count
- Column E: Last Updated
- Column F: Images Count
- Column G: Links to Tours (Yes/No)
- Column H: Notes

** Tab: Advantour - Content Gaps **
- Column A: Opportunity Area (Photography, Culinary, Textile, Archaeology, Adventure, Solo Female, Comparison, etc.)
- Column B: Specific Topic
- Column C: Why It's a Gap (no posts, superficial coverage, no tour tie-in)
- Column D: Our Competitive Advantage (we offer this!)
- Column E: Blog Post We Could Write
- Column F: Estimated Value (High/Medium/Low)

## WHAT TO DO WITH RESEARCH FINDINGS

**After Research Complete:**

1. **Prioritize opportunities** (High/Medium/Low value)
2. **Create detailed briefs** for top 20-30 posts
3. **Start content creation** (Phase 2)
4. **Focus first on:**
   - Keywords directly tied to our tours
   - Content gaps with zero competition
   - High buyer intent keywords
   - Easy wins (low competition, decent volume)

**Our Competitive Advantages to Emphasize:**
✅ Photography tours (nobody offers)
✅ Culinary workshops (nobody offers hands-on)
✅ Textile/craft immersion (nobody offers)
✅ Archaeology expeditions (nobody offers comprehensive)
✅ Aral Sea adventure (few offer, none document well)
✅ Solo female specific content (competitors generic)
✅ Comparison content (show our confidence)

**Note:** While manual research is time-consuming, it's MORE ACCURATE than automated tools because:
- We actually READ the content
- We understand the nuance
- We see what customers experience
- We find gaps tools miss
- It's FREE (just takes time)

## BUDGET FOR COMPETITOR RESEARCH

**Free Tools Only: $0**
- Time required: 40-60 hours of manual research
- Who does it: You, intern, or hire virtual assistant ($5-10/hour)
- Timeline: 2-4 weeks

**Paid Tools (Recommended for Efficiency):**
- Ahrefs trial: $7 for 7 days
- SEMrush trial: Free 7 days
- Total: $7 for 2 weeks access
- Value: Get all data in days instead of weeks
- Can export everything, then cancel

**Human Research:**
- If hire VA: 50 hours × $8/hour = $400
- If you do it: Your time (but you learn market deeply)

**Total for thorough research: $7-$400**

**ROI: Infinite** (content based on good research will drive bookings for years)

---

## ACTION DECISION POINT

**We now have two options:**

**Option A (Recommended - DO Research First):**
- Spend 2-4 weeks doing proper competitor research
- Document everything in spreadsheets
- Identify 30-50 high-value content opportunities
- Create detailed briefs before writing
- THEN start content creation
- **Result:** Strategic, focused, high-impact content

**Option B (Start Writing Now):**
- Skip detailed competitor research
- Use our keyword list (already have some)
- Start writing posts immediately
- Research as we go
- **Result:** Faster start, but may miss major opportunities, less strategic

**My strong recommendation: DO THE RESEARCH FIRST**

Just like with tours - research revealed massive opportunities (photography, culinary, archaeology, adventure gaps). Same will happen with blog content!

It will be tedious work, but it will pay off massively.

---

**WHO should do research?**

A. **You do it:** Learn market deeply, understand competition, make strategic decisions
B. **Virtual Assistant:** You supervise, review findings, make strategic calls
C. **Agency/Hire researcher:** Get raw data, you analyze for strategy

**I can:**
- Create all research templates
- Provide methodology
- Help analyze findings
- Create content briefs from research
- But someone needs to manually click through competitor sites and document

**Should we proceed with Option A (research first) and I'll create templates and help you execute? Or would you prefer I start creating blog post briefs based on what we already know and research in parallel?**
