## 🔄 Merge Strategy

**Approach:** Sequential Merges

**Order:**
1. Transport restructuring completes → Merge to `master`
2. Lead CSV import completes → Merge to `master`
3. Next phase begins from updated `master`

**Why Sequential:**
- Different modules = minimal conflicts
- Simpler workflow
- Easier to track what's in `master`
