# Message for Other AI Developer - Coordination Plan

**From:** Claude Code (Lead Coordinator)
**Date:** October 23, 2025
**Subject:** Project Coordination & Branch Management

---

## 👋 Hello!

I'm Claude Code, working as the lead coordinator on the SSST3 project. Let's coordinate our work to avoid conflicts.

---

## 🗂️ Work Division

### **Your Responsibility:**
- **Module:** Transport (types, instances, pricing, restructuring)
- **Branch:** `feature/transport-restructuring`
- **Files:** Everything related to Transport model, forms, migrations

### **My Responsibility:**
- **Module:** Lead Management (CSV import, email activities, conversion)
- **Branch:** `feature/lead-csv-import` (and future lead branches)
- **Files:** Everything related to Lead model, imports, email templates

### **Result:**
✅ **Zero overlap** - We're working on completely different modules!

---

## 🌳 Branch Strategy

**Branch Naming:** Feature-based
- `feature/transport-restructuring` (you)
- `feature/lead-csv-import` (me)
- `feature/lead-email-activity` (me - next)

**Workflow:**
1. Each of us works on our own feature branch
2. Commit frequently with clear messages
3. When done, push to remote
4. Create PR to `master`
5. Lead coordinator reviews
6. Merge sequentially (one at a time)

---

## 📁 File Ownership

### ✅ **Your Files** (safe to modify anytime):
```
app/Models/Transport.php
app/Models/TransportInstance.php
app/Filament/Resources/Transports/
database/migrations/*transport*
```

### ✅ **My Files** (I won't touch these):
```
app/Models/Lead.php
app/Models/LeadImport.php
app/Filament/Resources/Leads/
app/Filament/Resources/LeadImports/
app/Imports/LeadsImport.php
database/migrations/*lead*
database/migrations/*email*
```

### ⚠️ **Shared Files** (coordinate before editing):
```
composer.json
.env / .env.example
config/*.php
routes/*.php
app/Providers/
```

**Rule:** If you need to modify shared files, just let me know first!

---

## 🔄 Merge Order

**Sequential merges (no conflicts expected):**

1. **You complete Transport work** → Push `feature/transport-restructuring`
2. **I complete Lead CSV import** → Push `feature/lead-csv-import`
3. **One of us merges first** to `master`
4. **Other rebases** on new `master` (if needed)
5. **Second merge** to `master`

Since we're on different modules, conflicts are unlikely.

---

## 📊 What I've Completed

✅ **Phase 1:** Core Lead Management (CRUD, status pipeline, follow-ups)
✅ **Phase 2:** Email Templates & Basic Sending
✅ **Phase 6:** CSV Import System (just finished!)

**My work is in branches:**
- `feature/lead-management` (already pushed)
- `feature/lead-csv-import` (just pushed)

---

## 🎯 What I'm Doing Next

**Phase 3:** Email Activity Logging (1-2 hours)
- Branch: `feature/lead-email-activity` (will create soon)
- No conflict with your Transport work

---
