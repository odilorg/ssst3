## 📊 Sprint Plan - Current Iteration

### Priority 1: High Business Value (Week 1)

#### **Phase 6: CSV Import System** 👈 LEAD COORDINATOR
**Branch:** `feature/lead-csv-import`
**Assigned to:** Claude (Lead)
**Priority:** HIGH (Critical for data input)
**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours
**Status:** 🔵 READY TO START

**Why This First:**
- User needs to import hundreds of leads from scraped data
- Blocks no other features (independent)
- High business value
- No dependencies on email system

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Lead import model & migration
- [ ] CSV file upload with validation
- [ ] Field mapping interface
- [ ] Preview before import
- [ ] Duplicate detection
- [ ] Import history tracking
- [ ] Filament import page
- [ ] Documentation

**Technical Decisions:**
- Use `maatwebsite/excel` package (Laravel Excel)
- Store import history in database
- Implement chunk processing for large files
- Validate data before inserting

---

#### **Phase 3: Email Activity Logging** 👈 OTHER DEVELOPER
**Branch:** `feature/lead-email-activity`
**Assigned to:** Other AI Developer
**Priority:** HIGH (Completes email foundation)
**Estimated Time:** 1 hour
**Status:** 🟡 ASSIGNED - WAITING FOR DEVELOPER

**Why This Second:**
- Completes the email system foundation
- Enables tracking of all communications
- Required before bulk sending (Phase 4)
- Builds on Phase 2 (already complete)

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Email activity timeline per lead
- [ ] RelationManager in LeadResource
- [ ] Activity logging for status changes
- [ ] Email history view
- [ ] Auto-log sent emails
- [ ] Manual activity logging (calls, meetings)

**Technical Specifications:**

// Create email_activities table
Schema::create('email_activities', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->id();
    $table->foreignId('lead_id')->constrained()->cascadeOnDelete();
    $table->foreignId('user_id')->nullable()->constrained();
    $table->string('type'); // email_sent, email_received, status_change, note, call, meeting
    $table->string('subject')->nullable();
    $table->text('description');
    $table->json('metadata')->nullable(); // email_log_id, old_status, new_status, etc.
    $table->timestamp('activity_at');
    $table->timestamps();
});
```

**Files to Create:**
- `app/Models/EmailActivity.php`
- `database/migrations/2025_10_23_create_email_activities_table.php`
- `app/Filament/Resources/Leads/RelationManagers/ActivitiesRelationManager.php`
- `app/Observers/LeadObserver.php` (for auto-logging status changes)

**Integration Points:**
- Hook into `EmailService::send()` to auto-log
- Add observer to Lead model for status changes
- Create relation manager for LeadResource

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### Decision Log

#### **AD-001: Use Laravel Excel for CSV Import**
**Date:** October 23, 2025
**Decision:** Use `maatwebsite/excel` package instead of native PHP CSV functions
**Reasoning:**
- Laravel-native package with excellent documentation
- Handles large files with chunk processing
- Built-in validation and error handling
- Consistent with Laravel ecosystem
- Used elsewhere in codebase (check existing dependencies)

**Implementation:**
```bash
composer require maatwebsite/excel
```

---

#### **AD-002: Email Activity as Separate Model**
**Date:** October 23, 2025
**Decision:** Create separate `EmailActivity` model instead of polymorphic activity log
**Reasoning:**
- Simpler implementation
- Lead-specific features only (no need for polymorphism)
- Easier to query and filter
- Can expand to polymorphic later if needed
- Performance: direct foreign key vs polymorphic lookup

---

#### **AD-003: Chunk Processing for CSV Import**
**Date:** October 23, 2025
**Decision:** Process CSV imports in chunks of 100 rows
**Reasoning:**
- Prevents memory exhaustion on large files
- Better error handling (can identify specific chunks with issues)
- Progress tracking possible
- Can be queued for background processing

**Implementation:**
```php
Excel::import(new LeadImport, $file, null, \Maatwebsite\Excel\Excel::CSV, [
    'chunk_size' => 100
]);
```

---

#### **AD-004: Duplicate Detection Strategy**
**Date:** October 23, 2025
**Decision:** Check duplicates by email (primary) and website (secondary)
**Reasoning:**
- Email is most reliable unique identifier
- Website as fallback (some leads have no email)
- Company name alone is unreliable (too many similar names)
- Show duplicates to user, let them decide (skip/update/create anyway)

**Implementation:**
```php
// Check for duplicates
$duplicate = Lead::where('email', $row['email'])
    ->orWhere('website', $row['website'])
    ->first();
```
