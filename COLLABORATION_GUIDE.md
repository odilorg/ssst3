## üå≥ Git Branching Strategy

### **Current Branch Structure**

```
master (or main)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/lead-management ‚Üê YOU ARE HERE
    - Phases 1-2 complete
    - Phases 3-7 remain
```

### **Recommended: Split Remaining Work**

To avoid conflicts, create **sub-branches** from `feature/lead-management`:

```
feature/lead-management (base - keep stable)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/lead-email-activity      (Phase 3)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/lead-bulk-email          (Phase 4)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/lead-email-tracking      (Phase 5)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/lead-csv-import          (Phase 6)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/lead-conversion          (Phase 7)
```

**OR** if working on other modules entirely:

```
master
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/lead-management          (leads - current)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/booking-enhancements     (other work)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/customer-reports         (other work)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/contract-improvements    (other work)
```

## ü§ù How to Collaborate Without Conflicts

### **Strategy 1: Work on Different Phases**

**Developer A (You):**
- Phase 3: Email Activity Logging
- Phase 6: CSV Import

**Developer B (Other AI):**
- Phase 4: Bulk Email Sending
- Phase 5: Email Tracking

**Branch workflow:**
```bash
# Developer A
git checkout feature/lead-management
git pull origin feature/lead-management
git checkout -b feature/lead-email-activity
# ... do work ...
git commit -m "feat: implement email activity logging"
git push -u origin feature/lead-email-activity

# Developer B
git checkout feature/lead-management
git pull origin feature/lead-management
git checkout -b feature/lead-bulk-email
# ... do work ...
git commit -m "feat: implement bulk email sending"
git push -u origin feature/lead-bulk-email
```

### **Strategy 2: Work on Different Modules**

If working on completely different parts of the application:

**Developer A:**
- Lead Management features (Phases 3-7)
- Branch: `feature/lead-*`

**Developer B:**
- Booking system improvements
- Branch: `feature/booking-*`

**Advantage:** Zero file conflicts!

## üìÅ File Ownership Map (Conflict Prevention)

### **üî¥ High-Risk Files (Coordinate Before Editing)**

Both developers might need to modify:

```
app/Models/Lead.php                              ‚ö†Ô∏è COORDINATE
app/Filament/Resources/Leads/LeadResource.php    ‚ö†Ô∏è COORDINATE
app/Filament/Resources/Leads/Tables/LeadsTable.php ‚ö†Ô∏è COORDINATE
.env                                              ‚ö†Ô∏è COORDINATE
config/mail.php                                   ‚ö†Ô∏è COORDINATE
```

**Protocol:** Before editing these files, communicate:
```
"I'm adding email actions to LeadResource.php"
"I'm adding CSV import methods to Lead.php"
```

### **üü¢ Safe Files (No Conflicts)**

**Phase 3 (Email Activity):**
```
app/Models/EmailActivity.php                     ‚úÖ NEW FILE
database/migrations/*_create_email_activities_table.php ‚úÖ NEW FILE
app/Filament/Resources/Leads/Pages/EmailActivityRelationManager.php ‚úÖ NEW FILE
```

**Phase 4 (Bulk Email):**
```
app/Jobs/SendBulkEmailJob.php                    ‚úÖ NEW FILE
app/Actions/Filament/BulkSendEmailAction.php     ‚úÖ NEW FILE
```

**Phase 6 (CSV Import):**
```
app/Imports/LeadImport.php                       ‚úÖ NEW FILE
app/Filament/Pages/ImportLeads.php               ‚úÖ NEW FILE
database/migrations/*_create_lead_imports_table.php ‚úÖ NEW FILE
```

## üîÑ Daily Workflow

### **Morning Routine (Before Starting Work)**

```bash
# 1. Switch to base branch
git checkout feature/lead-management

# 2. Get latest changes
git pull origin feature/lead-management

# 3. Create/switch to your feature branch
git checkout -b feature/lead-email-activity
# OR if branch exists:
git checkout feature/lead-email-activity

# 4. Merge latest changes from base
git merge feature/lead-management
```

### **End of Day (After Completing Work)**

```bash
# 1. Commit your work
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement email activity logging"

# 2. Push to remote
git push -u origin feature/lead-email-activity

# 3. (Optional) Create Pull Request
# Via GitHub UI or:
gh pr create --title "Email Activity Logging" --base feature/lead-management
```

### **When Other Developer Pushes Changes**

```bash
# If they merge to feature/lead-management:
git checkout feature/lead-management
git pull

# Update your branch:
git checkout feature/your-branch
git merge feature/lead-management
# OR
git rebase feature/lead-management
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Configuration Coordination

### **Zoho SMTP Setup (Required for Phase 2+)**

**Current state in `.env.example`:**
```env
MAIL_MAILER=log  # Change to 'smtp' for production
MAIL_HOST=smtp.zoho.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your-email@yourdomain.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-zoho-password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="your-email@yourdomain.com"
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
```

**Coordination needed:**
- **Developer A:** Uses their own Zoho credentials in local `.env`
- **Developer B:** Uses their own Zoho credentials in local `.env`
- **Never commit** actual credentials to git
- Only update `.env.example` with documentation

### **Queue Configuration (Required for Phase 4)**

Both developers will need:
```env
QUEUE_CONNECTION=database  # Already set
```

Run queue worker:
```bash
php artisan queue:work
```
